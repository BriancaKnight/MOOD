## Description
An emotional regulation app for children ages 4-7. This app was created to address the need for emotional regulation tools for children and provide opportunities for kids and their grown-ups to navigate big emotions in a way that is accessible and engaging for young users. By focusing on interactive activities and tools, the app empowers children to understand and manage their emotions while fostering open communication and collaboration between children and their caregivers. The platform aims to offer a safe and supportive space where children can learn emotional intelligence and resilience, laying the foundation for healthier relationships and emotional well-being.

## Stretch Goals
* Add a "Breathing Exercise" functionality where users can blow out candles, spread the seeds of a dandilion, or make a kite fly in the wind to encourage centering and regulation.
* Add a "Sensory Touch Drawing Board" where users can experience thereputic art with brushes that vibrate on different frequencies.
* Create different age groups for users. Currently the app is aimed to 4-7 year olds, and I would like to create a 8-11, 12-15, and "grown" age classes with more targeted help. 
* Create user profiles to keep track of moods, journals, and artwork made in the drawing board.
